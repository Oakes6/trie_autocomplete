Code for Project 3 : Autocomplete for COMP3270 (Algorithms) in the Fall 2017 semester. This repository includes code to implement, test, and analyze autocomplete for a given set of N terms, where a term is a query string and an associated nonnegative weight. That is, given a prefix, find all queries that start with the given prefix, in descending order of weight.

Code implemented by me (Tanner Oakes):
   - AutocompleteTest.java (Test suite)
   - Methods in the TrieAutocomplete class from Autocomplete.java
      -- TrieAutocomplete()
      -- add()
      -- topMatches()
      -- topMatch()
      -- weightOf()
